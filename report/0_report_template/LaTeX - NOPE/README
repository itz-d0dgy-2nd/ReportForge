# LaTeX

If you find yourself asking: Damn I wish this supports LaTeX. Please action the following:
 1. Fork this repo
 2. Whisper \frac{sadness}{hope} into the void # Yes I know this LaTeX is invalid
 3. Try not to cry. Cry a little anyway.
 4. Push your branch and make a PR: 
   a. With the LaTeX code you wrote for this
   b. With the latexDespairCounter incremented and your github username
